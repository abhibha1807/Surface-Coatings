# Machine learning R 
This repository contains the R markdown implementation of assignments and the final project for the course 'Introduction to Machine Learning in R' by Prof Joseph Yurko.

## Final project: 


The final project for my machine learning course was sponsored by PPG Industries which is a fortune 500 Company. Surface coatings play a role in the manufacturing of products from common household goods, eyeglasses, buildings, cars, planes, and more! Coatings prevent corrosion and prolong the useful life of industrial materials, components, and machinery. Without a properly designed surface coating, the materials we interact with would not last as long as we want them to!
A coating is created by combining multiple constituent materials together. The constituents are combined in a manufacturing process following a specific set of operating conditions. Each batch of material produced is tested by applying the coating to a
specimen. The specimen is subjected to an accelerated life test. The specimen is exposed to extreme temperatures and humidity for long periods of time. The test conditions force corrosion to occur much faster than would normally occur to simulate years of typical material use. After the test is complete, the amount of corroded surface is recorded.
Properly designing coating materials requires experts in chemistry and chemical engineering, materials science, manufacturing, experimental design, materials testing, quality control, and more. Experiments are performed to find the optimal material chemistry and manufacturing process conditions that minimize the amount of corroded surface after a test. 

Recently, machine learning methods have become an important tool to aid traditional design techniques. Machine learning models are trained using historical data to predict material performance. The trained machine learning models are then used to find the optimal constituents and process settings to minimize corrosion! Machine learning expertise is required to know how to properly apply the methods! This project aims to do this by performing a comparative study between various Bayesian machine learning techniques to predict the percentage of corrosion on the surface.
